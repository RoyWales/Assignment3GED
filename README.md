This is my project 3 and I implimented a Dirty Flag that when toggled saves the key positions to a log file.

Game Description: The game we have built is based off of my assignment 2. The goal is for the player to collect all the keys which will unlock the door so they can reach the exit pad to win. There are enemies in the game and if they touch you long enough to bring your health to zero you lose. You can also lose by falling off the world.

Controls: WASD to move, Right clicking on the path spawns a key, Z to undo the last key, P to create a log file of the key positions, R to redo the last key, 1 to spawn fast enemy, 2 to spawn slow enemy

Screenshots: Under the ScreenShots folder

My working build of the game is in the build folder

Thrid Party Acknowledgement: I used my assignment 2 base which used: the unity manual to clear a few things up https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html and also used the movement script that we created for our GDW game and it used tutorial 4 and 5 to help with setting up patterns and I used the enemy prefab we created for our GDW game.
For this assignment I used tutorial 7 to help set up the dirtyflag optimization.
